# Moonlit water and woodland · v3

> The v3 master remains editable, but the current `forest` catalogue entry uses [GPT v6](ancient-forest-v6.md). Only the retained `depths`, `garden` and `heart` entries use v3 renders; the default sculpted game view displays the common v6 forest in every chapter. Old runtime exports are now recoverable from Git history rather than all retained in the current asset directory.

This update improves the four chapter backgrounds using the locally installed Blender 5.2.1 LTS. It opens the existing original v2 master and saves a separate editable v3 master. The v2 master, v2 renders, sprite source library and current social preview are preserved.

## Editable files and runtime separation

```

Blender edits are made in the v3 master, then rendered and published. The Canvas animation is separate from the static image, so replacing a render preserves the game's motion controls. The four semantic IDs remain `forest`, `depths`, `garden` and `heart`; sprite IDs and dimensions are unchanged.

## Construction and inputs

- Parent geometry: `art/source/procedural/nocturne-environments-v2.blend`, whose source hashes and original numerical construction are recorded in the v2 recipe.
- Upgrade script: `tools/art/upgrade_procedural_environments_v3.py`, using local helpers from `build_procedural_environments.py`.
- New work: a winding pool surface, stretched procedural water normals, broken reflective filaments, a distant luminous sphere, suspended moss fronds, small bank blossoms and a different warm/cool lighting composition for each chapter.
- The foreground trunks, hand-defined leaf topology, banks, existing plants and distant tree layers remain editable. The old flat distant canopy disks are hidden for these four renders, revealing more sky and depth.
- Actual Cycles area/spot lights pass through a numeric volume; no painted light-ray image is imported. Geometry additions use Python's local random generator with seeds `26091330` through `26091333`.
- Forest combines teal water with pale gold light; depths uses blue and lavender; garden uses silver green and blush; heart uses amber and moss green.
- No images, models, HDRIs, textures, photographs, fonts or logos were downloaded or imported. No image-generation API was used. Materials are numeric values and Blender shader nodes.
- The v3 `.blend` also retains an unchanged `share` scene inherited from v2; it is not a newly generated v3 output. Site publication continues to use `share-v2.png` and its v2 evidence.

## Exact production commands

From the repository root:

```bash
# Create a new v3 master from v2. This refuses to replace an existing v3 file.
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background art/source/procedural/nocturne-environments-v2.blend --python-exit-code 1 --python tools/art/upgrade_procedural_environments_v3.py

# Review without replacing final images or saving the editable master.
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background art/source/procedural/nocturne-environments-v3.blend --python-exit-code 1 --python tools/art/render_procedural_environments_v3.py -- --only forest --percent 50 --samples 18 --draft

# Render the current editable master. This never reconstructs or saves it.
/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background art/source/procedural/nocturne-environments-v3.blend --python-exit-code 1 --python tools/art/render_procedural_environments_v3.py -- --samples 48

.venv-art-build/bin/python tools/art/publish_art.py
npm run check:assets
node tools/record-visual-provenance.mjs
npm run build
```

During initial visual iteration, the upgrade command was repeated with explicit `--replace` to rebuild only the new v3 master. Do not use that flag for normal manual editing: it discards v3 edits and reconstructs the upgrade from v2. The source v2 file is never overwritten by this script. The renderer also rejects reduced-resolution final output unless `--draft` is provided.

All four final PNGs are RGB, 1536 × 1024, Cycles 48 samples with denoising, seed 1709, AgX and exposure −0.15. Cross-version/platform rendering may change pixels; the adjacent JSON identifies the delivered bytes rather than promising cross-platform bit-identical rendering. Publication strips source metadata and creates quality-88 WebP exports at the same dimensions, with immutable hash filenames. Older runtime files are retained for offline clients; the release builder includes only the current manifest's files.

## Authorship record and future edits

The coding assistant created the scripted additions in this user-authorized workspace. This is not a claim of human-only authorship, exclusive ownership of common geometric motifs, or an unconditional legal clearance. The new Blender API scripts are covered by the scoped [GPL source-script notice](../../tools/art/LICENSES.md); that notice does not impose a blanket license on the output artwork or the whole game.

`procedural-environments-v3.json` records the original parent master, saved v3 master, scripts, output hashes, scene inspection and render configuration. Future manual edits should be accompanied by a new generation record identifying the edited master and outputs. Running the generic provenance recorder alone records current bytes; it does not certify new authorship or turn changed sources into verified generation evidence.
